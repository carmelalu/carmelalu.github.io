<h2 id="interDesign">What is Interrogative Design?</h2>

    <p>Interrogative design, a term coined in the 90’s by Krzyztof Wodiczko, is an approach that 
    provides critical orientation, design principles, and communication techniques that can open 
    up new avenues for questioning, debate, and conceptualizing difficult topics. It’s a way of 
    designing unusual objects that stimulate public discourse, promoting the ability of artists 
    and designers to generate wider discussion on topics that receive little attention through 
    market forces. It helps spur society to think through complex topics where traditional media 
    and mainstream public education failed, usually by using techniques that are often unusual 
    and unsettling. They resonate with initial meaning yet, leave their audiences in an unresolved 
    state that ask them to participate in subsequent stages of meaning making.</p>

    <p>In Krzyztof’s own words, “Interrogative design questions the very worlds of needs of which it 
    is born. It responds interrogatively to the needs that should not but unfortunately do exist 
    in the present civilized ‘world’. In the unacceptable world, interrogative design should present 
    itself and be perceived as unacceptable.” Interrogative design holds up a lens to issues of 
    injustice, and if effective should make itself obsolete. Artists employ the technique of product 
    design and performance to disrupt the statis quo provoking new ideas and conversations around 
    topics essential to thriving democracies. It interrupts the public and gives them new symbolic 
    and cognitive tools to consider complex problems, focusing on important social problems and exposing 
    the issues to vivid public debate.</p>

    <p>An important aspect of interrogative design is that it seeks to provoke viewers to produce more 
    novel questions. It is based on the idea of pushing back on design’s impulse to solve things, 
    creating questions is more important than creating a viable solution. Another key component in 
    the process is that it involves communities of people from the beginning of the design process 
    through to the end where the artworks are experienced in public space. The public play a vital 
    role in interrogative design, with many artists and communities using these works as an instrument 
    for storytelling and often as part of therapeutic healing process. The public also brings about 
    the agonistic element in interrogative design, creating strong opinions in public space as a point 
    or counterpoint to some debate. Agonism suggest that a thriving democracy doesn’t come about by 
    organizing around deliberative consensus-building processes but rather envisions an open sphere 
    of ongoing contention and opposing interests never resolved, constantly shifting and transforming.</p>

    <p>Some may say that interrogative design aims for the same goals as speculative design, questioning 
    and solving larger societal issues. But the main difference between these two disciplines is that 
    interrogative design is focused on the present moment, whereas speculative design looks towards 
    the future and what could be. It thrives on imagination, asking what you do and don’t want to see 
    in the future and imagines what it would be like to design without the current limitations of 
    technology, culture, and politics in mind. Interrogative design is more grounded, focusing on 
    current issues that people face every day and brings up discussion and possible solutions so we 
    can envision a more secure future. </p>

    <p>Interrogative design was originated by Krzyztof Wodiczko who was trained as an industrial designer 
    in the 60s during a communist ruled Poland. His progression from commercial practitioner to artist 
    and social commentator was shaped by the political environment that was highly aversive to dissent 
    yet, was much in need of it. In one of his earliest subversive creations in a professional context, 
    he managed to quietly include an off switch in wall mounted speaker boxes without raising the 
    attention of the communist’s sensors. This small feature provided the wide public with the uncommon 
    luxury of being able to switch off public announcements in the totalitarian communist state. Outside 
    of his professional context, his early artistic works included rhetorical vehicles such as Pojazd, 
    in which a single driver would pace back and forth on a platform, in contemplation, causing a tilting 
    mechanism to transform the shifting weight into forward driving momentum. Such a safe non-statement 
    was both safe from censorship and yet sent a clear message about the potentially subversive act of 
    free thought in a totalitarian regime.</p> 

    <p>Krzyztof’s thinking was influenced by thinkers such as Michel Foucault and Bertolt Brecht who, the 
    former, explored the nature and importance of fearless speech in producing a healthy democracy. The 
    latter described a new form of theater, named the Epic Theatre, that sought to jar its audiences 
    out of the hypnotic slumber of romantic storytelling illusions through the techniques of interruptions 
    and alienation. Art, according to Brecht, should produce thought not numbness. Later, Kryztof was 
    influenced by the writings of Chantal Mouffe, who formalized the idea of agonistic democracy, an 
    important aspect of interrogative design.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>Krzyztof Wodiczko eventually immigrated to Canada and the US where he developed his best-known work, 
    the Homeless Vehicle. On the surface, it was an attempt to solve homelessness through the creation 
    of a custom designed cart for itinerant people to live in. However, it was motivated more precisely 
    by an interest in questioning the very conditions that give rise to homelessness. The project sought 
    to create an almost absurdist solution, so as to provoke inquisitiveness and protest, directing 
    attention to provoke a deeper discussion of the use as a whole. It created a public spectacle and 
    acted as a mediating device between the lives of homeless people in the city who are normally invisible 
    to most of the other citizens of the city and became a way to initiate contact between the rest of 
    the citizens and the homeless citizens of the city where they can begin to tell their stories through 
    the device itself.</p>

    <p>It certainly generated a fair amount of press and was even featured in a Canadian film board 
    documentary where Eric Roth, the director of Bowery Mission, New York, responded in an interview 
    about the vehicle in a way that really shows how interrogative design works “I find the concept 
    offensive. The solution is not cardboard shacks or cardboard shacks on wheels. The solution is real 
    housing… Assuming that Krzysztof is a talented artist who cares to apply his art to the problem of 
    homelessness, poverty or hunger there is a lot of productive ways to do it that are not as 
    attention-getting as designing a homeless vehicle for people to live in, but they are much more 
    pragmatic and could very much impact the on functionality of programs like this one in serving the 
    homeless” (Interviewed by Derek May in Krzyztof Wodiczko: Projections (1991), National Film Board 
    of Canada). Artists should not use their energy to do this sort of thing, but a better use of it 
    would be to volunteer or create the actual solution – don’t make art, make the actual thing.</p>

    <p>Krzyztof goes on to respond saying “[The project] exaggerates, pushes even further exactly to the 
    point of very dark and frightening absurdity. Of course the vehicle must be rejected it brings more 
    information and confronts the non-homeless, provides the possibility for direct dialogue, discussion 
    about the program of this vehicle” (Interviewed by Derek May in Krzyztof Wodiczko: Projections 
    (1991), National Film Board of Canada). The vehicle is a critique of economic inequality in the 
    extreme capitalistic society of the 1980s, and even now, and is meant to directly confront the issue. </p>

    <p>Orkan Telhan, an interdisciplinary artist, designer and researcher, created a live data-driven 
    performance called United Colors of Dissent (2013) in Istanbul, France, and Austria. Participants 
    were posed a variety of questions on which they can vote on using their mobile phones in their 
    preferred language. Results were then compiled into a real-time graphic displayed on a large, 
    public video screen and on the participant’s phones. Questions asked related to both personal and 
    communal matters such as healthcare, education, religion, and immigration. According to 
    <a href="https://www.orkantelhan.com/ucod#:~:text=United%20Colors%20of%20Dissent%20(UCoD,running%20on%20their%20mobile%20phones.">
    Telhan’s website</a> about the work, “The performance intends to capture the linguistic and socio-cultural 
    profile of different communities in urban environments by creating real-time visualizations that 
    can map the prejudices, assumptions, and biases we may have about each other”. By collecting local 
    community opinions, under-recognized questions and concerns are highlighted and awareness about 
    certain discussions can be brought up. His work also uses the agonistic model of decision-making, 
    acting as a mediating device re-introducing different publics opinions on topics such as interventions 
    to public spaces or changes on policies and reforms. </p>

    </figure>

    <p>Stand By You: Add Oil Machine 並肩上: 打氣機 (2014), by the group <a href="-	https://www.facebook.com/addoilteam">
    Add Oil Team 打氣小隊</a>, was a spontaneous four-month project by artists Sampson Wong and Jason Lam 
    during the Hong Kong Umbrella Movement. The team strategically projected messages of solidarity from 
    around the world onto key government buildings in Hong Kong for the protesters to see, creating a 
    sense of support from those outside of the country and bringing it to the public space of the protest. </p>

    <p>“In response to the protester's demands, the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Communist Party 
    strengthened its control of media and educational institutions and escalated its harassment of 
    students, scholars and protesters, quietly subduing oppositional voices and language through 
    administrative and bureaucratic protocols” as stated by <a href="https://slought.org/resources/add_oil_machine">
    Slought</a>, a non-profit organization engaging in cultural and socio-political change. Not only is 
    the project a form of creative solidarity but can be understood as a linguistic form of resistance 
    to the Hong Kong government’s power and process. Slought goes on to say that “A majority of the messages 
    of solidarity were written in Cantonese, the primary language in Hong Kong yet one that is secondary 
    to Mandarin, the standardized Chinese dialect spoken in Mainland China, Taiwan and Singapore. Cantonese 
    people are often compelled to explain themselves in Mandarin to be understood in Mainland China and other 
    parts of Asia, such that using Cantonese in everyday life is an affirmation of one's minoritarian cultural identity 
    and sense of community. This project thus invites us to interrogate the politics of and relationship 
    between Cantonese and Mandarin. Here political messages in Cantonese, a minor language, are being 
    projected onto governmental sites of power whose association with Mandarin and Mainland China is 
    precisely what is being contested.” The project spurs questions and a deeper discussion about the 
    politics and relationships between Cantonese and Mandarin. </p>
